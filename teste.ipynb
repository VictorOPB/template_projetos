    "# Investment Strategy: A low-volatility and momentum strategy with LSTM neural network 1-day\n",

    "Based on LSTM stock prediction values, we calculate 1-day future returns, analysing SP&500 stocks and selecting the desired stocks to add to the portfolio through a 'low-volatility-momentum' strategy. First we analyze the data history to find a value to the maximum volatility accepted, then we analyze the momentum scores of the stocks using three different periods (21-days, 63-month and 126-month momentum scores), selecting a reasonable momentum threshold in accordance to the distributions of these scores, thereafter selecting some interesting stocks. The final momentum score is calculated by using a weighted momentum average of weigths 0.4 for 21-days momentum and 0.3 for 63-days and 126-days momentum and must be greater than the momentum threshold. We pre-select the stocks to be invested based upon these two criterias: they must pass the volatility and momentum tests and then we get the best 10 stocks momentum scores (this number of stocks can vary if more stocks are necessary).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this test we chose volatility and momentum thresholds as 0.2 and log(1.1), respectively. The reason for the last choice is that it captures all stocks with an average appreciation of 10%.\n",
    "\n",
    "  A momentum strategy is a strategy to buy past winners and to sell past losers. It's a bet on the ability of past returns to predict future returns - academic literature has documented evidence that momentum profits are significantly positive and pervasive across multiple time periods."
